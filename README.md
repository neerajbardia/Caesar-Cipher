# Caesar-Cipher
Caesar cipher is a very old cipher technique, it got its name from the roman emperor Julius Caesar, as he used to use it extensively.
In this cipher technique the letters of the plain text are replaced by, traditionally a key value of 3, i.e. the letter preceding the actual letter by 3 places.
for example: letter 'D' will be replaced by the letter 'A' in caesar cipher.
